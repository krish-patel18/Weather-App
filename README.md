# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## ðŸš€ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will **hot-reload** when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is **minified**, and filenames include **content hashes**.  
Your app is now **ready for deployment**!

See the [Deployment](#deployment) section for more information.

### `npm run preview`
Serves the production build locally for testing before deployment.
